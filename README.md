# Emby Duplicate Movie Finder

## Overview

This project is a web-based tool designed to help Emby users identify duplicate movies in their media libraries. I created this tool after facing a small yet frustrating issue with duplicates in my Emby setup. There are generally two types of duplicates that this tool helps identify:

1. **Same Movie with Multiple Files**: When you have two or more files of the same movie in your library.
2. **Misidentified Movies**: When Emby mistakenly identifies one movie as another.

## How It Works

The Emby Duplicate Finder is easy to use and works in any environment. You just need to provide your Emby server's URL and an API key. The tool will then scan your movie libraries for duplicates, comparing movie names and production years.

If duplicates are found, the tool displays them by library and provides the option to download a list showing each movie's name and file path. This makes it easy to review and manage duplicates directly from your browser.

## Features

- **Simple Setup**: No complex configurations required. Just enter your Emby server URL and API key.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works in any environment with a modern web browser.
- **Duplicate Detection**: Identifies duplicates by comparing movie names and production years.
- **Downloadable Results**: Provides an option to download a list of duplicates, showing the movie names and file paths.
- **Open Source**: The project is open-source, allowing anyone to contribute or modify the code as needed.
